# Minnesota-Traffic-Volume
The Minnesota Department of Transportation contacted you about building a dashboard to help their team monitor traffic patterns. Their goal is to learn more about: 

1. Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, week, day, and hour

2. Traffic volume in different weather conditions

3. Traffic volume on different holidays

Knowing traffic patterns under these conditions will help the team make important infrastructure decisions. These decisions will ensure that any construction in the future wonâ€™t cause problems for drivers.
